You have to provide the transition matrix and sequences to run the program.

In the example folder I provide a transition matrix and a bunch of CDS sequences to run the program.

This program outputs the name of the sequence, PN, PS, PN/PS, PN/(PN+PS) * length of the sequence, PS/(PN+PS) * length of the sequence.
